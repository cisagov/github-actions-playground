| Google Cloud | Looker |  |  | Unknown | [link](https://cloud.google.com/log4j2-security-advisory) | \Looker-hosted instances have been updated to a Looker version with Log4j  v2.16. Looker is currently working with third-party driver vendors to evaluate the impact of the Log4j vulnerability. As Looker does not enable logging for these drivers in Looker-hosted instances, no messages are logged. We conclude that the vulnerability is mitigated. We continue to actively work with the vendors to deploy a fix for these drivers.  Looker customers who self-manage their Looker instances have received instructions through their technical contacts on how to take the necessary steps to address the vulnerability. Looker customers who have questions or require assistance, please visit Looker Support. |  | [cisagov](https://github.com/cisagov/log4j-affected-db) | 2021-12-18 |
