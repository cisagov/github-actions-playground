| Apache | Tomcat | 9.0.x |  | Affected | [link](https://tomcat.apache.org/security-9.html) | Apache Tomcat 9.0.x has no dependency on any version of log4j. Web applications deployed on Apache Tomcat may have a dependency on log4j. You should seek support from the application vendor in this instance. It is possible to configure Apache Tomcat 9.0.x to use log4j 2.x for Tomcat's internal logging. This requires explicit configuration and the addition of the log4j 2.x library. Anyone who has switched Tomcat's internal logging to log4j 2.x is likely to need to address this vulnerability. In most cases, disabling the problematic feature will be the simplest solution. Exactly how to do that depends on the exact version of log4j 2.x being used. Details are provided on the [log4j 2.x security page](https://logging.apache.org/log4j/2.x/security.html) |  | [cisagov](https://github.com/cisagov/log4j-affected-db) | 2021-12-21 |
